* Why does the ELBO decrease in some iterations ?
* Change to argparse:
	- The save/load system.
	- Algorithm parameters: max_iter, verbose
* Change to dictionaries to get rid of ugly unpackings.
* Store iteration informations in order to create graphs.
* Write the README.md
* Write in the report:
	- Results obtained.
	- Numerical tricks used, matricial form of the equations.
	- Cases where it fails, instabilities.
	- Compare with spectral clustering.
